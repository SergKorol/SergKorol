I'm a seasoned Software Engineer with over eight years of
experience in the IT industry. I began my career as a manual QA

expertise is in .NET/C#, complemented by substantial experience in
JavaScript and TypeScript. Currently, I am broadening my skill set in
DevOps, with a focus on cloud computing and containerization
technologies. Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about
mentoring fellow developers and sharing my knowledge through a
technical blog that has attracted a thriving community of several
thousand subscribers.
